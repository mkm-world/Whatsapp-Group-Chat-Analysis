# Whatsapp-Group-Chat-Analysis
## Introduction
DSN FUNAAB is the student community of the Data Scientist Network at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta. It is the group of all data scientists and data enthusiasts in FUNAAB. The WhatsApp group was created to connect data scientists in the university and share resources, upcoming events, and opportunities with community members.

This project is an analysis of messages in the DSN FUNAAB Whatsapp group. The Data Extraction and Processing were done with Python and visualization using Power BI. I wrote a Medium post explaining my insights in more detail. Check it out HERE
